```plaintext
# Ignore build artifacts
*.exe
*.dll
*.bat

# Ignore debug files
debug_*.png

# Ignore SDL2 configuration
sdl2-config

# Ignore temporary or generated files

*.tmp

# Ignore Visual Studio Code folder
.vscode/

# Ignore library files

# Ignore compiled object files (if applicable)
*.o
*.obj

# Ignore backup files
