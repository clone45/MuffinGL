I'm so glad that worked! Let me walk you through the solution in a friendly, easy-to-follow way.

The issue boiled down to how the **mask texture** was being applied to the `workingTexture`. When you render a texture using alpha blending, the RGB and alpha channels are blended together, often leading to unintended effects. In this case, the "shadow" effect happened because the mask's RGB values (white) were blending with the cleared `workingTexture` (black), rather than just updating the alpha channel as intended.

### The Fix

To solve this, we adjusted how the mask texture was rendered. Specifically, we used `BlendMode::None` for the mask rendering step. This ensured that the mask's **alpha values were copied directly** to the `workingTexture`, without blending the RGB values. By doing this, we avoided the "darkened ring" artifact entirely.

Hereâ€™s the full explanation:

1. **Clearing the `workingTexture`**: Before rendering anything, we cleared the `workingTexture` to fully transparent (`RGBA = 0, 0, 0, 0`). This gave us a clean slate to work with, ensuring no leftover data from previous frames affected the result.

2. **Rendering the Mask**: When rendering the mask, we used `BlendMode::None`. This allowed the alpha values from the mask to overwrite the alpha channel of the `workingTexture` directly, leaving the RGB channels untouched (still black). This was key to eliminating the shadow effect.

3. **Rendering the Grass**: Next, we rendered the grass texture using `BlendMode::Multiply`. This multiplied the grass texture's RGB and alpha with the mask's alpha values, effectively "applying" the mask. The RGB of the `workingTexture` remained untouched, which meant no shadows!

4. **Blending the Final Result**: Finally, we blended the `workingTexture` over the dirt background using `BlendMode::Alpha`, which composited the masked grass texture onto the dirt.

### The Updated Code

Hereâ€™s how the main loop looks with these adjustments:

```cpp
while (running) {
    Graphics::Event event;
    while (graphics.pollEvent(event)) {
        if (event.type == Graphics::EventType::Quit) {
            running = false;
        }
    }

    // Calculate the mask's position (animated movement)
    time += 0.016f;
    float x = std::cos(time) * 50.0f;
    float y = std::sin(time) * 50.0f;

    graphics.clear();

    // Step 1: Draw the dirt background
    dirtTexture.render(50, 50);

    // Step 2: Clear the working texture to fully transparent
    workingTexture.clear(0, 0, 0, 0);

    // Step 3: Render the mask into the working texture (overwrite alpha)
    maskTexture.render(
        workingTexture,
        static_cast<int>(x),
        static_cast<int>(y),
        BlendMode::None // No blendingâ€”directly overwrite alpha
    );

    // Step 4: Render the grass texture, modulated by the mask's alpha
    grassTexture.render(
        workingTexture,
        static_cast<int>(x),  // Match the mask's position
        static_cast<int>(y),
        BlendMode::Multiply // Multiply grass RGB/alpha with the mask's alpha
    );

    // Step 5: Blend the final working texture over the dirt background
    workingTexture.render(50, 50, BlendMode::Alpha);

    // Present the rendered frame
    graphics.render();
}
```

### Why It Works

- **BlendMode::None**: This ensured that only the alpha channel from the mask texture affected the `workingTexture`. By disabling blending, we avoided any unintended mixing of RGB values.
- **Controlled Pipeline**: Each rendering step had a clear purpose: (1) clear the texture, (2) apply the mask's alpha, (3) modulate the grass texture, and (4) composite the final result.
- **Transparency Preserved**: The RGB values of the `workingTexture` remained black until the grass texture was applied, ensuring no leftover colors caused artifacts.

### Debugging Tips
If you ever suspect blending issues in the future, try saving intermediate textures (e.g., after rendering the mask or grass) to verify their contents. This can quickly reveal where blending might not be working as expected.
