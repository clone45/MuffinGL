# MuffinGL

⚠️ **WARNING: This project is in early development and is NOT ready for production use!** ⚠️

MuffinGL is a friendly wrapper around SDL2 that aims to make graphics programming simpler and safer. The project is currently experimental and under active development.

## Prerequisites

This project is currently set up for Windows development only.

Required software:
- A C++ compiler (MinGW recommended)
- Git (for cloning the repository)

Note: SDL2 libraries are included in the repository for Windows, so no additional SDL2 installation is needed.

## Building the Project

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MuffinGL.git
cd MuffinGL
```

2. Run the build script:
```bash
./build.bat
```

If successful, this will create the executable in the current directory.

## Running the Project

After building, you can run the project by executing:
```bash
./main.exe
```

## Project Status

This is an experimental project focused on creating a safer, more intuitive interface for SDL2. Key features are still under development, and the API is subject to change.

Currently implemented:
- Basic window and renderer management
- Safe texture loading and manipulation
- Event handling
- Texture wrapping and blending support

Please note that this project is not yet suitable for production use.
